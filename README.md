# A short tutorial for Cobrawap hands-on sessions

Cobrawap (Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline) is an adaptable and reusable analysis pipeline for the multi-scale, multi-methodology analysis of cortical wave activity. The pipeline ingests data from heterogeneous sources of spatially organized neuronal activity, such as ECoG or calcium imaging recordings, as well as the outcome of numerical simulations. The pipeline returns statistical measures to quantify the dynamic wave-like activity patterns found in the data.

The open-source software for Cobrawap official releases is available [here](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/cobrawap), and fully documented [here](https://cobrawap.readthedocs.io).

The different folders refer to the different hands-on we have been delivering up to now:
- *"2024_Napoli_EBRAINS_Italy_Plenary"*: The 2024 plenary [workshop](https://www.fuorirottaeventi.com/ebrains-napoli) of the EBRAINS-Italy project in Naples, Italy;
- *"2025_Brasov_EBRAINS_Italy_School"*: The 2025 EBRAINS-Italy training simulation [workshop](https://conf.snn.ro/ebrains) in Brasov, Romania.

In each event, we focused on a different use-case by using a different release of Cobrawap, possibly with features at that time still under development and hence not yet available through the standard package distribution. For detailed instructions about the installation, configuration and the hands-on itself, refer to the README file within each folder.
