# A "deep anesthesia imaging" test dataset

## The dataset

This trial comes from the following dataset:

- *Study of Slow Waves (SWs) propagation through wide-field calcium imaging of the right cortical hemisphere of GCaMP6f mice*

by F. Resta, A. L. Allegra Mascaro and F. S. Pavone, publicly retrievable at [https://doi.org/10.25493/QFZK-FXS](https://doi.org/10.25493/QFZK-FXS).

Here a short description:

*Slow waves (SWs) are spatio-temporal patterns of cortical activity that occur both during natural sleep and anesthesia and are preserved across species. Even though electrophysiological recordings have been largely used to characterize brain states, they are limited in spatial resolution and cannot target specific neuronal populations. Recently, large-scale optical imaging techniques coupled with functional indicators overcame these restrictions and will give new important insight on the SW phenomenon. Here we combined wide-field fluorescence microscopy and a transgenic mouse model expressing a calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) in excitatory neurons to study and model SW propagation.*
