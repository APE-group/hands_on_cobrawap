# A "spiking hippocampus" test dataset

## The dataset

This trial is a teaching-purpose elaboration of a simulation of hippocampus spiking activity; original data are produced by CNR-IBF (and partners) in the framework of the EBRAINS-Italy PNRR project. Here, a simplified geometry is introduced, and data are represented as numpy arrays. Processing applied to original data includes: 2D-projection, spatio-temporal downsampling, normalization, time convolution; the sub-set of active nodes is considered. As a result, information is mapped on a 2D regular grid; the coordinates of the nodes in the down-sampled network are listed as well.

Further details will follow.
